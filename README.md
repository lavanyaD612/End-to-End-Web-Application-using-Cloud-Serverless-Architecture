# End-to-End-Web-Application-using-Cloud-s-Serverless-Architecture

Cloud computing involves accessing computing resources (like storage, databases, and servers) over the internet, providing scalability and flexibility. Serverless computing abstracts server management, allowing developers to focus on writing code without provisioning or managing servers, leading to reduced operational overhead and cost.

AWS SERVICES USED:
In this project, we will be using 7 widely known and very easy-to-use services (NOTE: serverless services). All these 7 services are available under the free-tier accounts, so it doesn't require us to pay even a single penny. The following are the services used in our project:

1. CodeCommit
2. IAM
3. Amplify
4. Cognito 
5. Lambda
6. DynamoDB
7. API Gateway
